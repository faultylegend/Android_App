# Back Your Board Games

## Purpose
We are designing an app that compiles data on different kickstarted board games and displays that information to the user.
This will be useful for making a decision whether one should purchase a board game or not based on different statistics.

## How we are making it
Using android studio, we will make a mobile application that directly connects to kickstarted using the kickstarter status API
